## Tested rPPG algorithms for Heart Rate estimation

> Remote photoplethysmography measures heart rate of a person without any contact, from their video

1. rPPG - pos 
    > Not offcial 

    - Github link = https://github.com/pavisj/rppg-pos
    - implementation of rPPG called as Plane Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) asdescribed in the IEEE paper 
        - {"Algorithmic Principles of Remote PPG," W. Wang, A. C. den Brinker, S. Stuijk and G. de Haan}
    
2. Spectral Reflectance-based Heart Rate Estimation from Facial Video 
    > Official
    > Conference - ICIP 2019

    - Github link = https://github.com/ArvindSubramaniam/Heart_Rate_from_Facial_Video
    - Output is not Heart rate but crominance
