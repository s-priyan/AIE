# **RPPG tested Algorithms**
-  **Meta-rPPG** 
  - only training available
- **Deep-rppg**
  - need arguments to train and infer
- **STVEN-rPPGNet**
  - need to add dataloader,data preprocessing and post preprocessing
- **nasir6/rPPG**
  - real time inference available but no official paper implementation
